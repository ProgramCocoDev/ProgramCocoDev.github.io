            <p>I was fascinated by game development from the moment I asked myself: "How did they do that?" This curiosity arose while playing World of Warcraft, where the boss battles, mechanics
              and
              strategies captured my interest. Over time, this hobby expanded to include Souls and Metroidvania games.

              When I play, I always look at how the mechanics have been developed, how the NPCs behave and how the story is told to the player. I also like procedural map generation because I think
              it
              allows for a great variety of situations.

              I enjoy developing tools that make some kind of work easier or better, and I enjoy creating entertaining shaders using mathematics. My history with video games started with the PSOne,
              playing titles such as Crash Bandicoot and Spyro. I grew up playing a wide variety of games including Ratchet & Clank, Jak & Daxter, World of Warcraft, Dark Souls and many more.

              My other hobbies include going to the cinema, reading manga/anime, playing sports and, in recent years, reading. I like to challenge myself.

              I am always ready to learn new things.
